Inspired by Yayoi Kusama and other artists that play with the ethereal spacial effects of light and mirrors, I created an infinity mirror revealing a cavernous, womb-like interior speckled with reflecting lights with the effect of opening a mystical space for contemplation and self-reflection. <br><br> <img src='full/womb2.jpg' class='full'> <br><br> <h2> fabrication + interaction  </h2> <img src='full/wombprocess.jpg' class='full'> <br><br> To create a mirror with curving, organic form, I used 2D modeling software to laser cut acrylic and chipboard sheets for layer-by-layer assembly. <img src='full/wombconcept.jpg' class='full'> <br><br> I chose to use user proximity to control the frequency of the fading LEDs to evoke the idea of the mirror as a life-like, personal space that becomes an individualized experience when someone closely interacts with it. As someone faces the mirror, the attached sensor reacts to physical proximity to make LEDs \"breathe\" with greater intensity and speed, highlighting the sense of intimacy attached to the experience of self-reflection. <br> <br> <iframe src='https://player.vimeo.com/video/142698614' width='500' height='281' frameborder='0' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <br> <br> ~ "; content["pulse"] = '		<img src="full/pulse.jpg" class="full"> <br> <i>april 2015 <br> heat-formed acrylic, electroluminescent wire, arduino, pulse sensor </i><br><br> As part of a lighting unit design class in the Design and Computation group within MIT\'s Architecture Department, I explored product design, interaction, and digital fabrication as an interative process. Starting as an imitation of an existing product (the <a href="http://roxyrussell.com/medusae-collection/">Hydra pendant</a> by Roxy Russel), my project went through several iterations through form, material, lighting, and iteraction to eventually come together as a final piece inspired by delicate, organic forms and the idea of an intimate interaction with an electronic interface. <h2> previous iterations </h2> <img class="full" src="full/pulseiterations.jpg"> <br> <br> During my project\'s progression, I wanted to develop the relationship between a vulnerable lighted core and its exterior acrss various materials, transitioning from a mylar exterior diffusing an incandescent light bulb to EL wire surrounded by a heat-formed acrylic petal-like shell. Across these transformations, I chose to explore how to create a lighting unit with a sense of intimate softness in its relation to a user. <br> <br> <img class="full" src="full/pulseforming.jpg"> <br> <br> While preparing for my final product, I learned about how to make the process of fabrication more structured, using tools and techniques such as laser cutting and heat forming a sheet of acrylic to achieve my desired, organic form. <h2> final iteration </h2> My final iteration examined how to incorporate interactivity. Continuing the idea of the light as a vulnerable core surrounded by a transparent exterior, I wanted to explore the concept of the lighted core as a metaphor for a living heart by making the EL wire "pulse" in response to human biometrics.<br> <br> <img class="full" src="full/pulsestoryboard.jpg"> <br> <br> In particular, the biometric of heart beat was a personally resonant decision, especially since I tend to check my pulse in times of stress as a calming mechanism. This led me to consider the interactivity with the lighting unit as a therapeutic companion in times of anxiety.<br><br> The user can place their finger onto a connected sensor from SparkFun that reads their pulse, in turn illuminating the lighted core to the rhythm of their heartbeat. <br> <br> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/154554507" width="500" height="480" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> <br> <br> <br> <br>~' ;
